# ApartmentList Challenge Submission
My submission to the ApartmentList coding challenge.

## Basic Info
Written entirely in JavaScript.

Dictionary files are included in the "dictionaries" folder.

Network.js includes all of the functions that are used in solving the challenge.

Challenge.js utilizes Network.js to solve the challenge specifically for the word "LISTY" and the full dictionary as posted in the Github for the challenge.

## Scripts
`npm run start` will run Challenge.js and output the size of LISTY's network and the time it took to calculate that network.

`npm test` will run a series of automated tests on Network.js. You will have to run `npm install` first though, since my tests use the `Mocha` and `Chai` packages.
